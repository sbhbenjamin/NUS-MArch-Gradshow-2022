      'The position, importance, duration, and contribution of design “Thesis” is a contentious and constantly debated subject in numerous architecture programmes. Final degree projects, a single super studio, options studio, or an optional thesis often conclude a student’s architectural education. At the Department of Architecture (DOA) at NUS, despite all the promise, anxiety, and challenges with the experience of design thesis, the Department is firmly committed to the thesis for all our terminal students. It is a critical milestone to secure a Master of Architecture degree.',
      'The Department of Architecture has recalibrated the thesis experience this academic year after significant internal discussion and debate from a one-year design thesis into a one-semester research report and a one-semester design thesis.',
      'The curriculum change garnered many voices for and against it. The legacies of the one-year design thesis run deep in the DOA program. Students in this cohort and numerous faculty members (some of whom are alumni of the programme), looked to that historical one-year thesis model as a precedent and expressed frustration that an expedited thesis time frame would negatively impact student research. However, establishing a one-semester design thesis in a 10-semester programme allows students to run a concurrent options studio in their fifth year of study while allowing a one-semester internship in practice and the option to spend time as an exchange student overseas. This expanded curriculum space provides additional flexibility and opportunities for different forms of learning in a wide range of contexts. This elasticity is especially critical where diverse knowledge, lateral thinking, and broad experiences help form our graduates. Furthermore, the one-semester design thesis creates a framework for students to act and make architecture with a speed and definitive decision-making process aligned to how the built environment is contemporarily formed today in Singapore and Southeast Asia.',
      'This semester, the high-quality research and impactful, thought-provoking design provocations exceeded last year’s standards regardless of the curriculum change. I was confronted with challenging and powerful design ideas from formal explorations, digital evaluative frameworks, tectonic assemblages, and cultural and community-driven research through design. The range of provocations is the role of the thesis – to provoke and challenge the shifting and blurry edges of architecture, and this one-semester experience proves that time is not the only factor in high-quality design outcomes.',
      'On a personal level, this year represents the last year in my role as a programme director. I began the undergraduate programme directorship in 2015 and became Master of Architecture director in 2020. Almost seven years of leadership is a significant amount of time to assist in crafting the education of an architect in Singapore. I look back on this time with a fondness for the collective efforts of the faculty and student body to improve and refine the structure and outcomes of the programme. Moreover, the change to a one-semester design thesis is only one small part of that collective effort. There is a strong foundation here, structured to the discipline of architecture while being open and nimble to be at the forefront of architectural change in the years to come. Congratulations go to the graduating Master of Architecture class and to all the staff and faculty who work tirelessly behind the scenes to make the education of an architect at NUS happen.',

      'Congratulations to you for making it as Architecture graduates. As you eagerly step out of our proverbial school gates towards your next adventure beyond NUS, most of you would unlikely be thinking of your "trials and tribulations" endured in the past years. Hence, I would like to take this brief moment to celebrate your learning experience, express our appreciation of and aspirations for you. We are truly proud of you as NUS graduates. You had not only made it through our demanding Master of Architecture programme, but you had done it through a pandemic, and a major school merger. I hope that this experience translates to your resilient spirit that grows your confidence to face whatever life and work will throw at you.',
      'I see architecture to be a very unique field of study and practice because it pulls in different directions to achieve balance. As designers, you develop and express ideas to innovate on forms and function. You apply critical thinking and skills to optimise solutions that align human needs, urban and environmental constraints, as well as social and sustainability aspirations. You conserve cultural heritages, connecting them to history, and communicate their value in society. You create something beautiful, clever, useful, and inspiring. Although these may be some of the loftiest aspirations for our designers, the most important outcome that we truly wish for you, our graduates, would be a NUS learning experience that opened your mind and taught you skills that made you adaptable and resilient in your career.',
      'As you graduate into the world beyond school, I would urge you to continue on with an open mind towards learning. Continue to hone your craft so that you can hold your own, while feeling unencumbered to work interdisciplinarity with folks of different training and be empathetic towards their different points of view. The real-world industrial problems are typically complex, and it tends to take a diverse team to solution it. From built environment to product design, a effective team that leverages different talents is typically needed to solution for all the stakeholders.',
      'I would conclude by wishing you all a great adventure ahead. I hope you have earned a valuable and memorable experience through your "trials and tribulations" with us. Please continue to connect with us as alumni and bring your experience back to enrich the learning experiences of your juniors who are walking closely behind you. All the best and our heartiest congratulations to you earning your graduation!',

      'Heartiest congratulations to the 2022 Graduating Class! I am delighted to celebrate with you as you have completed and are about to enter into your career, either in architecture or other fields. The last three years had not been easy for you, as our facilities were under renovation and you have to work in decanted spaces scattered around the campus.',
      'In addition, obviously the disruption brought on by the pandemic severely restricted in-person studio and other opportunities to meet with classmates, friends and teachers. However, despite these hurdles, you have come through with flying colours and achieved many excellent projects. We at the department are very proud of you.',
      'The pandemic has allowed us to rethink our priorities and our values. What do the years of architectural education equip us to do? With the pandemic and the turbulent international situation, is it not time to consider how we can contribute to the social good? Starting from home, with our training, how can we address the issues of climate change, sustainability and urban heat? Further down the road, massive reduction of carbon footprints and seawater rise are just two of the essential tasks we need to engage in. And I am sure the education at DoA will give you both the desire and the know-how to contribute to the dire climate issues facing humankind.',
      'The second priority is social harmony and well-being. We live in a society that requires us to prioritise the needs of the underprivileged, the silver generation, and ensuring the thriving of an inclusive community. We can achieve this with our design, as shown in many of your thesis proposals.',
      'Lastly, I am encouraged that the years you spent here at NUS will provide you with life-long problem solving skills through design. Our training opens our eyes and frames our perspectives. Critical and lateral thinking is key in design and is also essential to achieving rational solutions. Likewise, the ability to work collaboratively will be the fundamental in your career and such skill must have been honed in your education here.',
      'These are some of the values I hope we have instilled in you while your entrusted your architecture journey with us. Whatever you choose as your occupation in the future, be it architecture, allied disciplines or other career pathways completely different from architecture, the core values are important in these different fields. I wish you well in your future endeavours. Embrace your passion for architecture, uphold the values I outlined and enjoy whatever life may bring you. Again, I thank you for entrusting us with your studies and congratulations on completing this remarkable journey.',
