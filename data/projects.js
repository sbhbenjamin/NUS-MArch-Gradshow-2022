      'Verbal communication between people has always existed in space. This thesis posits that the role of architectural space in the conveyance of the spoken word goes beyond acoustics. Its ability to transform and shape the spoken word will train a novel way of seeing space-form when considered in tandem with speech communication, in a time where sound clips and podcasts have challenged the hegemony of printed text in recent years. Ruige’s thesis explores the elemental space-form as carriers of the spoken word in design generation. From perusing how the grandeur of a political speech reverberates through convex shapes to conjuring spirituality through sustained chanting in a tubular tower, Ruige’s world of handmade terra-cotta and tin instruments explores a fundamental cognitive bridge between space-form perception and the empirical quality of verbal communication.',

      "The thesis explores the relationship between curating, archiving, community engagement, and the emergence of a new space for art antithetical to a traditional museum's design, use, and meaning. By positioning everyday objects as relational agents and carriers of social history, the thesis recontextualises the institutional setting of curating and archiving by embedding the practices amidst the Chai Chee community in Singapore. The objects provide opportunities for conversations and storytelling to happen and the possibility of a new distributed museum typology for socially engaged art in the twenty-first century.\n",

      'Memories of disasters cease to exist in people’s mind, especially when a physical entity that triggers such memories are wiped out. Engaging with the history of hydrogen-bomb-experiment by the U.S., and the recent existential threat by the sea-level-rising in Bikini Atoll, the project attempted to resist against such disappearance by commemorating the events and postponing the submergence of the land and dilution of existing nuclear pollutant to the sea. The challenge is to perpetuate the traumatic experience for visitors through a series of architectural devices. The piled resin blocks that contain the visitors’ protective cloths, and architectural finish using copper plates register the visitors’ activities and turn them into a device to trigger the original memory of the experiment, while the tower of resin stood out from the sea’s surface demarcate the past existence of the events in the most essential manner.

Placed in a limestone quarry in Perak, Malaysia and taking its scurred landscape as a site, the project attempted to recover its original landform by using plastic wastes imported from overseas. Unrecyclable plastic wastes assorted in a plant are mounted over a series of structures that model on the original landform, and the space below is dedicated for a trail for tourists. In the distance view, the structural surface is integrated with that of the existing landform, while in the close-range view from below the structure, the distorted unsightly plastics are uncovered.

      'Finding ways to materialise ‘extra-territoriality’, Jeremy’s thesis explores a series of unusual ‘grounds’—part (inter)national entities, part cultural artefacts, part nature/bodies. His eventual proposition speculates with a bamboo forest within Singapore’s Botanic Gardens, as a hybrid ‘ground’ constituted by historic terrain, cultural monument, biological species, and architectural implement. The potential in Jeremy’s project lies in its reframing of nature-culture entanglements of architecture and the built environment.

      'Finding ways to materialise ‘extra-territoriality’, Jeremy’s thesis explores a series of unusual ‘grounds’—part (inter)national entities, part cultural artefacts, part nature/bodies. His eventual proposition speculates with a bamboo forest within Singapore’s Botanic Gardens, as a hybrid ‘ground’ constituted by historic terrain, cultural monument, biological species, and architectural implement. The potential in Jeremy’s project lies in its reframing of nature-culture entanglements of architecture and the built environment.

      "Sung Jian Wei John’s ambitious thesis attempted to address one of the most essential yet abstract issues in architecture: aesthetics, especially in the era of sustainability. He argued that new type of aesthetics should be called 'sustainable aesthetics', which could be defined as spectra between ephemeral natural aesthetics and permanent industrial aesthetics. The design studies were conducted by both graphical and material experiments. His rather calm yet sensitive personal traits drive him to communicate through a series of graphical experiments. He is hardworking, hands-on driven, joyful to work with. I wish all the best for his professional carrier progression.",

The challenge of the project is to express such an empathy through architectural design that intervenes and re-designs an existing environment to establish an alternative ecology where endangered species can survive better than now. Focusing on the Mekong Giant Catfish, the project aimed to enhance its habitat in Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia by providing architectural devices and modifying the landform. A linear architectural structure – a temporary fish tank, provides deep and safe habitat for the fish, while directing the flow of water to deepen the lakebed naturally and permanently.

The neighbourhood’s familiarity is preserved, but a new form of apartment for younger and more wealthy inhabitants is introduced to boost the area's economic and cultural vibrancy.

      "Rather than going all-in on gentrification or tourism-based development, as in the Xintiandi model, the thesis on the urban regeneration of Tianzifang in Shanghai, China, proposes mix-used mix-population conservation and redevelopment by retaining the majority of the existing community and adhering to the principles of cultural authenticity, social inclusivity, architectural integrity, and economic viability. The neighbourhood’s familiarity is preserved, but a new form of apartment for younger and more wealthy inhabitants is introduced to boost the area's economic and cultural vibrancy. The concept provides an intriguing alternative to China's urban redevelopment efforts.",

      "The thesis demonstrated an alternative to the enbloc and relocation approach in an ageing public housing estate, particularly in key core urban districts such as at the proximity of the Singapore River and Chinatown areas. The Jalan Kukoh public housing neighbourhood is considered one of Singapore's poorest areas, but the idea takes the opposite approach by preserving the current community, economically strengthening them, and empathetically restoring their dignity as equal citizens in rich and democratic Singapore. The planning method is centred on the creation of the new connection and activity node, as well as the placement of stimulating sub-nodes along the circulation tentacles. It is similar to acupuncture on the meridian points in that it creates and encourages healing energy throughout the city's anatomy.",

      'New Urban Village (Lin Ying Ying) interrogates the future prospects of the compact, superdense typology that sprung up alongside Shenzhen’s meteoric rise as an economic powerhouse. The demonstrative project is underpinned by a strong sense of social justice, and convincingly argues that urban villages can, and should be viably revitalised and transformed to continue providing the essential life support to the city, while preserving their autonomy and sustaining the social structure and fabric. A new mixed use taxi drivers’ amenity centre cum logistic hub anchors the urban village as the main ‘gateway’ building connected to the metropolis, while housing blocks undergo different degrees of intervention to improve liveability and conviviality. Compact high-rise ‘sharing towers’ are carefully inserted into strategic ‘urban acupoints’ to redefine and expand the public realm that is lacking currently.  The scheme demonstrates potential scalability and applicability for the depleting stock of urban villages in Shenzhen to achieve urban rehabilitation and socio-economic progress. ',

      'Singapore is exceptional in managing water as resource. Purification and reclamation of water require energy and it is a waste to use portable water to perform services such as cleaning the streets and watering the plants. As such, localized rain water harvesting in the city for non-portable use will be an essential approach to enhance our water management and energy conservation. Instead of storing the rain water in an hidden underground tank, Anthea aims to incorporate rain water harvesting and its treatment as an external architectural feature that improves and enlivens the city. This is a commendable approach.',

      'This project explored a different public housing typology focusing on passive design measures and the integration of vertical greenery in order to improve the capacity for shading and natural ventilation, while retaining privacy. Starting from a basic four-unit footprint on a tartan grid, each unit can be shifted in any of the four horizontal directions, creating overhangs, balconies, voids and semi-public gathering spaces. This is supported by a quantitative analysis of green, privacy, thermal comfort and balcony area for each unit. The configuration of the units adapts to the shifting with respect to the fixed structural system. A parametric implementation allows for a randomized, yet interesting and valuable  result.',

The opportunities created through compaction and decompaction of an existing public housing prototype is an interesting approach to repurposing the existing public housing stock. The design opens new avenues to investigate how an existing housing prototype can be re-programmed to support wide ranging uses and various living options.

      'Species extinction is linked to urban expansion. From that simple premise, this thesis attempts to create an Ecotone within an urban setting, defined as a space where two ecological conditions overlap. It starts with a critique of land use in Singapore, specifically, golf courses. The proposal blurs the boundary between architecture and landscape, urban and natural, capturing moments when the two worlds intersect. At the regional scale, the scheme defragments ecosystems, linking two ecologically rich parts of the island with a new forest-park, repurposed from golf courses, and creating new amenities that are easily accessible by residents of nearby residential areas.',

The proposal is conceptualized across different scales – from building scale food waste chutes, repurposed carparks for intensive farming, to a neighbourhood scale food management facility – The Food Valorist, and an elevated conveyance network to transfer food waste and organic fertilizer to support community in bloom programs that is also pedestrianized to activate and connect precincts. \n\nThe Food Valorist is conceived as a pedagogical tool to educate communities about food waste. Existing food market (food consumption and waste generator site) and a community centre (social node) are co-located with food production and waste processing/upcycling functions to form a new building typology.

The research into the evolution of rural Bangladesh housing has framed knowledge on the essential requirements of achieving a resilient, adaptive design at the housing unit scale. The unit scale entangles the development of villages, agricultural areas, and larger territories. The research illustrates the current shift from paddy farming to shrimp farming, impacting peri-urban and architectural formation. The design acknowledges that architecture and resilient housing alone cannot uplift the people's livelihood; instead, it is the collective considerations between both architecture and the entire social territory that enables a community to thrive alongside climate change.",

      'This focus is Singapore’s food system, its heavy reliance on imports, considerable waste and lack of waste recovery. The current system is reimagined from a land-use perspective, overlaying food production, distribution and waste handling onto the existing MRT network. Here, the mono-functionalism of large MRT depots in Singapore is questioned. A proposal for an urban farm within Bishan Depot carves out space for high-rise farms and underground logistics, linked to an MRT line that carries food to communities in the north and centre of the island. The proposal expands public space and reimagines the edge between Bishan Park and the Depot.',

The merger of waste processing with art is defining the public character of the edge between this former industrial area planned for revitalization and densification and the nearby green zone. The design, while deliberately relieved from unnecessary stylishness and stripped down to a functional reminiscence of constructivism, facilitates the transformation of genius loci, the urbanites as Flaneur and waste collection and its artistic manipulation into an amalgamated whole.

This resulted in a project that provides a fresh perspective on mundane, everyday urban spaces such as McDonald’s while breaking the preconceptions of what consumption space can be, how it can operate, and how one can achieve a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved.

The thesis asks, how might cultivation practices - in the actual ground - shape future urban form? Through the representation of existing gardens and unused spaces, the project unfolds to show how the sequential demolition and rebuilding of housing estates can create a variegated, extended field comprised of plantations, private gardens, wilding, and shared circulation with public programs. Overall, Astoria has successfully designed the intersection of the public housing building block and urban agriculture as a space of, and for, negotiation.',

      'This thesis is a narrative about a place where a Chinese woman can exercise her autonomy for deciding about her romance journey. It is a critical and witty reaction to the bizarre and contrived nature of match-making efforts in the anxious contemporary Chinese society. It engages the pertinent drivers by representing them as a composition of counterpoints – self and society, fantasy and realization, virtual and physical, traditional values and contemporary spirit, personal beliefs and cultural myths, sentiment and commercial intent. The value of this architectural outcome is an invention of a breath-taking public place suspended over an unforgiving network of highways, escaping from its traffic din, at the same time harnessing its night for the mesmerising scene of moving lights to be admired from above. Architecture becomes a satirical backdrop for a social commentary.',

The result is a green and blue corridor running through housing estates linking existing water-based natural areas on either end.
