      'Verbal communication between people has always existed in space. This thesis posits that the role of architectural space in the conveyance of the spoken word goes beyond acoustics. Its ability to transform and shape the spoken word will train a novel way of seeing space-form when considered in tandem with speech communication, in a time where sound clips and podcasts have challenged the hegemony of printed text in recent years. Ruige’s thesis explores the elemental space-form as carriers of the spoken word in design generation. From perusing how the grandeur of a political speech reverberates through convex shapes to conjuring spirituality through sustained chanting in a tubular tower, Ruige’s world of handmade terra-cotta and tin instruments explores a fundamental cognitive bridge between space-form perception and the empirical quality of verbal communication.',

      'The cheapening of data and information nowadays has enabled an increased reliance on aural & visual communication as a means of message conveyance among people and between people and architecture. The shift from textual means to aural and visual means to understand a concept or a space leads to implications on the design of architecture. The thesis explored the production of architecture under this premise, using the spoken sounds in English, such as various vowels and consonants as the material and principle of form construction. The visual forms as an end product rewires our association of form with meaning.',
      'The thesis includes two parts. Firstly, making form selection by experimenting and pairing spatial parameters with perceivably different spoken sounds. Secondly, form hybridization to bridge percepts (primary and secondary sound affects) and concepts of choice, hence, enabling a better understsanding of message intended (eg. centrality vs multiplicity vs sequence).

      'Using sound as the rule of form production of varied concepts, the project furthers meaning conveyance within a physical construct through both the auditory and visual experience that it carries.',

      "The thesis explores the relationship between curating, archiving, community engagement, and the emergence of a new space for art antithetical to a traditional museum's design, use, and meaning. By positioning everyday objects as relational agents and carriers of social history, the thesis recontextualises the institutional setting of curating and archiving by embedding the practices amidst the Chai Chee community in Singapore. The objects provide opportunities for conversations and storytelling to happen and the possibility of a new distributed museum typology for socially engaged art in the twenty-first century.\n",

      'My thesis investigates the making of a distributed museum of our everyday life. The thesis adopts the spirit of relational aesthetics, a contemporary art form which brings its theoretical horizon beyond the independent, private and symbolic space of a museum or gallery, focussing on the human relations and their social contexts. An example of relational aesthetics would be Rirkrit Tiravanija’s Untitled. He had served Thai curry soup to the exhibition visitors and had conversations with them during the experience. The art in this case is not the Thai curry soup, but the conversations and relationships that had been formed during the experience. ',
      'Against the backdrop of Singapore’s ageing population, the thesis asks how can the museum play a social mission in allowing the elderly of Chai Chee to age in place? In addition, how can the museum’s collection contribute to this mission? As such, the thesis’ museum departs from the setting of an institutionalised museum e.g national museums and private galleries. Instead, it approaches its collection, curation and design through a bottom-up and multi-scalar approach.',
      'The thesis has devised a three-fold exploration through relational ideals- the board game Housing Curiosities as a participatory site-surveying method in engaging the community to discover hidden-spatial meanings and relationships at site, a series of Everyday Structures to house the collection of objects and the Museum of Everday Life for a larger collection that would have accumulated over the years.',

The piled resin blocks that contain the visitors’ protective cloths, and architectural finish using copper plates register the visitors’ activities and turn them into a device to trigger the original memory of the experiment, while the tower of resin stood out from the sea’s surface demarcate the past existence of the events in the most essential manner.

      'A landform is a powerful icon that evokes sentimental longing and wishful affection for the past. Placed in a limestone quarry in Perak, Malaysia and taking its scurred landscape as a site, the project attempted to recover its original landform by using plastic wastes imported from overseas. Unrecyclable plastic wastes assorted in a plant are mounted over a series of structures that model on the original landform, and the space below is dedicated for a trail for tourists. In the distance view, the structural surface is integrated with that of the existing landform, while in the close-range view from below the structure, the distorted unsightly plastics are uncovered. The sunlight admitted through such plastic material might be fantastical although the material itself is pollutive. The ambivalent and mixed feeling constantly reminds visitors about the environmental pollution while evoking the nostalgia.      \n\n',

      'One implication arriving from the high-speed rail connection into Luang Prabang Laos, from Kunming China could be the descent of temporary refugees seeking respite from the common prosperity campaign currently undertaken in China.\n\nIt would be difficult to deny that some Buddhist devotees and practitioners in Buddhist liturgy chant and ritual could form part of this Chinese exodus, knowing previous Chinese Government’s action against religious sects. This would include practitioners who turn Buddhist liturgical chant into rock mantra. After all, Indo-China of which Laos forms part, is rich with Buddhist ritualistic practices. It will be in these temples that these practitioners will turn to absorb and fine tune their practices.\n\nThe site is the Wat May Souvannapourmaram. The Wat is in close proximity to the Royal Palace.

The thesis asks, how can ‘dirt’ practices be inserted into redevelopment processes, and in turn, inform future land use? Based on a close study of existing policy and its over-emphasis on bearing capacity, the project introduces a set of tactics that show processes of soil formation and deformation. The project also proposes novel collectives that grip onto the continued enrichment of the rhizosphere. By retrofitting existing machines, tools, and edges, Zhining has designed a remarkable micro-architecture for an understudied topic, urban soil.\n',
    abstract: [
      'Introduction',
      'Soil is generally thought to be firm and stable, yet geologically, it proves to be otherwise. It is subjected to localised pressures on the thinnest layers of our fertile soils to deep pressure from the earth’s core. These pressures are documented in a geological history that appears to have excluded humans, until recently. Scientists and historians have gathered new evidence, revealing the extent of human influence on soil as it has become visible not just horizontally, but also vertically by the accumulation of things like plastic and concrete, and actions that have penetrated the soil to its deepest strata, disturbing and mixing strata of eras that would otherwise never have met. The soil is never left to rest. (Aït-Touati et al., n.d.) This project locates architecture in a micro way, and asks, what does the rhizosphere say to architecture, instead of the current reverse. ',
      'Abstract',
      "Dirty and Green situates itself in Singapore and examines the past three urban policies that look at nature and the city. The recent shift from ‘garden’ to ‘nature’ is a policy change that accommodates ‘wild’ nature. The project argues that, the binary of city and nature is a good start in attempting to rewild the city, but it is not enough because the notion of ‘wild’ is not defined and it is evolving at present. In order to be precise, specificity about ‘what nature’ is required, and the selection of what to be specific about is political. The thesis argues that a policy of vaguely imagined ‘wildness’ is a barrier to actually addressing what a public, ecological city could be. The thesis argues within the current, ‘City in Nature' urban policy and in Singapore's constant state of becoming. I have imagined a dirty political agent that can expand the poorly defined ‘wild nature' and can shape urban spatial change in novel and necessary ways. My design action takes place in the rhizosphere, which is the importantly productive, thin layer around the earth where water, soil, subsoil, and the living world interact, and where human and nonhuman life and the resources that sustain it are concentrated. Can a ‘dirty’ confrontation with ‘City in Nature' inspire and open up future urban-nature imaginaries in new ways? The project hopes to encourage the proposal of similarly missing or forgotten dirty, ‘wild natures' for architecture-based research in Singapore.",

      "1. Mapping evidence of entanglement (Hodder, 2012) between rhizospheres and concrete in Singapore, shows that there is a problematic and counterproductive entanglement engendered by generic and utopic ‘fixes' for public space. ",
      "2. Project sites are selected based on a geologically loose logic selection in western Singapore based on soil. I select four sites and I situate myself in relation to them following a relational positionality (Kobayashi, 2019). Where I ‘see with' each site and bring various expositions to the specific soil site, rather than position myself as an outsider to nature and the city. Each of the four sites are represented through soil pigments that I collect from each site, converted to paint and applied on a series of not-to-scale, sectional diptychs. ",
      '3. Rejecting broad generalisations of standard, typical details, like sidewalks and scaffolding, which do not take account of the rhizosphere.

This requires the alignment of people and things, in ways that are responsive to uncertainties, materialities, and passions. It is one that activates the soil, and results in discernable change. This involves the collaboration with local soil collectives to mobilise and implement this protocol.',

In Ernest’s resort, spaces are designed to entice, distract with trappings that tell us continually we need to be better, plugged in and productive at all the times.

With this shift, not only has work been displaced from the office, but all spaces have been transformed, conditioning the worker to be productive in any space, and leisure has consequently become subsumed into one’s productive processes - sleep has become a process of recharging; exercise a means to improve one’s health; sociality an avenue for networking, etc. As these phenomena increasingly become reality, this thesis imagines the facades of leisure that work puts on in a hyper-productive world.',

      'The environmentalist’s dilemma describes how the environmentalist is unable to assert his reality of seeing intrinsic value in nature, for he is living in a reality that is inconsistent with the economic majority. His predicament suggests the existence of other such anomalies to hegemonic scientific thought, and forces us to consider the grounds from which such incommensurable constructs of nature have emerged. This thesis seeks to critique humankind’s inability to situate itself in the natural world, resulting in the inaptitude to properly tackle the climate crisis. Much like exotic creatures, just as the environment does not know how to cope with us, we do not know how to comply, for we have lost all sense of context and relatedness to this natural community which we are a part.',
      'The Galapagos Islands - a fragile archipelago rife with highly complex socio-ecological issues - is used as a vehicle to demonstrate the tension between actors holding different philosophies of nature.

The four contemporary nature philosophies of Resourcism, Preservationism, Ecocentrism, and Postmodern Nature Philosophy are translated into bijective abstractions of four actors in the islands. Through an investigation of spatial responses in a given scenario, human-nature relationships are critically re-examined with the goal of uncovering further insight to this fateful existence.',

Placed on Orchard Road in Singapore, a museum shop for mica-products introduces a creative hands-on experience to the consumers, while by using mirrors and projection, such an experience is overlapped with images of labor exploitation that occurs in the mining process. Staying in the space where the temperature and humidity are matched with the mine, and glancing at themselves in the overlapped images, the consumers would aware the fact while appreciating the mica as a precious product.

      'In Search of Sparkles is an investigation into the dual narratives of visible cosmetic beauty and unseen labour production surrounding Mica Mineral. Mica can be found in many cosmetic products, and it is a mineral that provides the shimmering and sparkling effect. ',
      'The project also looks at the ways in which the rapid proliferation of information is investigated, curated, and consumed by its relevant parties, the thesis is inspired by the recent bad press against the usage of Mica in cosmetic. These articles, revealing the ugly secrets of the Mica mining process, presented a greater topic of doctored media portrayal of cosmetic products by beauty companies to conceal the hidden unethical production of Mica. This formed a contrasting dialectic between the unreal beautified portrayal of the product and the hidden realities concealed within. As the beauty industry is about celebrating the ideal image of beauty, the revealing of Mica miners raises ethnical issues which would tarnish their reputation hence efforts were made to veil this issue. Companies such as Sephora exploits human desire to be beautiful through visual representations and the deployment of mirrors as a veil to continue the consumption cycle which is reflected at the space of consumption.  ',
      'The objective of this thesis project is to raise public awareness on mica mining through a position of a beauty company responding to the recent bad press, identifying that the issue is due to the isolation of consumer from the reality of the miner’s conditions that results in consumers who don’t understand or are not aware of the ‘cost’ of mica. The architecture strategy is to draw parallels between the mica mining site in India and the shop/spa experience, by manipulating the practices and expectations of beauty patrons while in pursuit of their personal beauty that creates the moment captured in the narcist painting while accentuating the intricate craft of mica harvesting. This is done so by interweaving 2 experiences of the spa and shop where the same spaces evoke a double meaning/ perspective. For the shop, this is done through the usage of reflection as a form of spatial device to engage with the patrons. As for the spa, it uses the flow of water and behaviour of clay to inform the spa sequence.  ',
      'However, as one starts to experience the commercial activity, a sense of ambivalence is evoked as the experience reveals an uncanny resemblance between the miners and patrons where the patrons’ behaviour and movements unknowingly transition similarly to a mica miner while searching for sparkles. Through this PR expression, it seemingly tries to uncover and convey the hardship of the miners, however it is undoubtedly still an attempt to veil the situation of mica mining in India.',

      'The Inner Coast rethinks disciplinary and territorial boundaries—not least because Rifqi’s project provides a reflexive means to rediscover the coastline within island-city Singapore. It reclaims what is often considered extraneous to architectural making, and uses disciplinary tools to express ways of seeing, giving value, and intervening with at-risk and undervalued landscapes. At the Clementi Forest canal, Rifqi utilises a designer’s sensibilities of making patterns and speculative ideas visible by articulating site-specific particularities and species-specific fragilities. His proposition boldly advocates that architecture reconsider how it should deal with and re-value its own interventions and output within these sensitive sites.      ',

      'Singapore’s coasts are no longer recognizable as they were. There is a change in the way people currently perceive the coast due to the city state’s developmental emphasis. Thus, coastlines are built up, manicured and privatized. The sea no longer sustains inhabitation, and the island-city’s coastlines are out-of-bound territories. This thesis relooks at Singapore’s interiorised land-water edges—the inner coast—found along a hidden canal in the Clementi Forest. It forges new embodied sensibilities and reengages vanishing archipelagic traditions of foraging.',

This inner coast is expressed as embodied knowledge gained through acts of walking,  touching, feeling, sensing, collecting, documenting, and experimentally installing detrital traps in the water. Reinterpreting the intimate relations that foragers have with the landscape, the thesis develops its tools to sense the site’s shifting topographies, highlighted through its socio-biological, and meteorological temporalities.',

      'Finding ways to materialise ‘extra-territoriality’, Jeremy’s thesis explores a series of unusual ‘grounds’—part (inter)national entities, part cultural artefacts, part nature/bodies. His eventual proposition speculates with a bamboo forest within Singapore’s Botanic Gardens, as a hybrid ‘ground’ constituted by historic terrain, cultural monument, biological species, and architectural implement. The potential in Jeremy’s project lies in its reframing of nature-culture entanglements of architecture and the built environment. It forces us to reconsider who/what are the makers and users of a transspecies architecture. In our more-than-human worlds, who/what are the collaborators, co-constructors, and co-inhabitants of our architectural futures?   ',
    abstract: [
      'Where does territory begin, and where does it end? The thesis poses this question in a speculative scenario where a cultural monument—the listed Symphony Lake at the Singapore Botanic Gardens—is facing invasion by the pervasive and fast-growing tropical bamboo species from the Garden’s new Bambusetum. The bamboo’s rhizomatic roots disobey territorial order; its shoots host a multiplicity of trans-species habitats. Sustaining the cultural monument through a collaborative and entangled structure and ‘terrain’, an evolving archipelago is constituted by multi-strata bamboo terrain, with occupiable spaces for humans and nonhumans alike. ',
      'The bamboo forest reconfigures the Symphony Lake’s sloping parkland and orchestral stage into an archipelago of shifting performance areas which appear and disappear with the forest’s seasonal cycles. An auditory shell is created from the rhythmic swinging of gondola ‘balconies’, capitalising on the flexibility afforded by the bamboo structure, gathering and bending the plant into cavernous forms that amplify the sound of the performers. As the forest grows denser, these shells become inhabited by frogs and crickets, who work alongside their human collaborators to co-create trans-species rhythms and sounds. As the bamboo invades into, and swallows up each performance area, the trans-species orchestra shifts to a new clearing within the bamboo-forest archipelago. ',
      'The proposition to imagine new trans-species interrelations between terrain, program, and users—challenging ideas of terrestrial/ territorial, and architectural/spatial fixity—produces a critique of a monument, one that is impermanent and fleeting, and thus, subverts colonial ideas of territory and terrain.',

The project is an anti-thesis to the idealistic vision of the emancipation of labour posited by historians and theorists - that Man will evolve from Man the Maker to Man at Play, as society progresses away from labour with the aid of technology. Through design, the project eventually reveals the realities of the late-capitalist society, driven by social media phenomenon. In this society, social media exploits both the sensational and the mundane of leisure into images for marketing, thereby twisting and decaying the intentions of the ideal leisure society. Leisure and its peripherals, in this society, are merely a mode of production for images to spur the leisure economy, therefore subsuming itself in labour.',

The towers become ever-changing vertical amusement parks and manufacturing machines of leisure, collectively creating a Hyper-Leisure City-scape.',
      'Thereafter, the project speculates a form of societal decay in the advent of capitalising leisure through its image. This ideal ecology of leisure is disrupted by the oversaturation of images.

      'To achieve a sustainability of the natural world, an empathy toward non-human species is inevitable.     The challenge of the project is to express such an empathy through architectural design that intervenes and re-designs an existing environment to establish an alternative ecology where endangered species can survive better than now. Focusing on the Mekong Giant Catfish, the project aimed to enhance its habitat in Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia by providing architectural devices and modifying the landform. A linear architectural structure – a temporary fish tank, provides deep and safe habitat for the fish, while directing the flow of water to deepen the lakebed naturally and permanently. The seasonal events facilitate people to work on the maintenance of the system. As a whole, project expected to create an alternative ecological sphere for the fish to survive',
    abstract: [
      'Tonle Sap Lake’s prominence as the world’s richest inland fishing ground, along with the distinctive spectacle of a seasonal flood pulse, is threatened with the converging impacts of climate change, overfishing and rapid and extensive urbanisation. Ecological degradation is at the forefront, with many aquatic organisms having lost their original living environment and some pushed to the brink of extinction. In particular, the thesis centres around the Mekong Giant Catfish (MGC), a cultural keystone species endemic to the Mekong River. By weaving the MGC’s migratory and seasonal flood pulse schedules around native practices and veneration for the MGC, the thesis examines and explores the mediated relationships between animal, environment and human. It engages the lake between two sites, leveraged in a temporal and shape-shifting architecture – event- and time-based. The architecture comprises of three systems: a water paddock-cum-deep pool formation, mangrove restoration through natural sediment deposition with sediment-stabilising freshwater mangroves and mangrove mimicry nursing grounds. Space is re-assessed through the point of view of the MGC. Architecture is designed around its manoeuvres and physiological behaviours in parallel to principles of river dynamics. The aim is to construct habitats using natural forces and reduce the dependency on technological intervention. Through the space and rituals of these native and natural events, the architectural proposition (at scales of infrastructure, designed with an ecological point of view) targets to catalyses tourism and ecological responsibility. This hopes to re-position the significance of fish conservation for the Mekong region.',

This ability to remain impartial is a clear position taken by Benjiao. This results in an architecture that is always on the edge, it frames the duality and possibilities but at the same time does not over project or promise. That perhaps is the best way to understand the future of the artist in the new the Beijing.',

Because of their creativity, they can always make their communities enjoyable but also bring about gentrifying. Every time commercialization takes over their neighborhood, they move to another fringe of the city.',

      'In 1982, the success of the state’s attempt to convert burial as the main mode of disposal to cremation in is often seen as a reflection of the weaking hold of “traditional” ideas and beliefs concerning death and the afterlife among Chinese Singaporeans. The thesis borrows records of Chinese death rituals in Singapore as a lens to understand the significance of Chinese values highly regarded their culture. The project also emphasizes on the importance of maintaining solidarity in the family through the efforts of commemorative rituals performed during funerals and mortuary ceremonies. In essence, it will bring to light the act of “remembering” that is the symbolic cement holding together a structure of family and lineage that is one of the foundations of Chinese culture.',
      'The nature of Chinese death rituals are malleable by nature, in that they are not anchored down to a textbook nor canonical rules and teachings. For the most part, it is highly pragmatic and rely on oral traditions, thus allowing changes to be easily introduced and accommodated. Therefore, when modernity suggests impracticalities when performing rituals in its “original” form, the rituals avail themselves to be manipulated with no major dissonance. While these forms have changed, the rationales and meanings behind the performances of these rituals have not. Understanding the rational behind these rituals will allow architecture to appropriately “repackage” these intangible markers as they continuously adapt to Singapore’s changing social tapestry, thereby steering the evolution of tradition in the right direction. Thus, this thesis project will highlight the importance of remembering the ghosts of our ancestors, and the stories of the people who came before us.',

      'A New Chitty Story (Benedict Khoo) is a sensitive study into how urban and architectural experiences can be crafted to portray the cultural identity of the Chitty people, and unearth the acculturation processes and transformation of this diasporic community over time, space and geography. Challenging immutable definition of cultural identity, the Chitty Cultural Centre eschews the usual institutional ‘meta-narrative’ approach, and instead seek to ‘nudge’ members of the community to rediscover and reconnect with the intangible heritage of cuisines, language, ceremonial rituals, and to re-examine these critically in the contemporary social, economic and political context. Through abstraction of urban and architectural morphology, scale and materiality familiar to the Chitties, ‘residential’ programmes are introduced into a row of conserved terraced townhouses to provide a truly immersive experience for visitors and members alike.

      'Beauty World Park (Chee Jia Xin) is inspired by a rigorous archaeological process that excavates and unearths the historical, social and cultural layers of the expunged Beauty World Market. Beauty World Centre (BWC) and Bukit Timah Shopping Centre (BTSC) are proposed to be rehabilitated and repurposed to serve new community needs and achieve economic revitalisation and urban intensification, eschewing the ‘tabula rasa’ approach. Through urban scale interventions such as the unifying sunken landscaped garden and podia-level decks across the entire city block, to surgical interventions such as remodelling of the existing atria of BWC into a naturally ventilated one that extends to a new urban plaza, the ambitious scheme offers a compelling vision of a socially and environmentally sustainable approach to the regeneration of Singapore’s ageing multi-strata mixed used developments.

      'Beauty World evolved through numerous layers of function and programs, eventually culminating in its life as an open- air market before being demolished. Today, the original Beauty World can be described as a place that has ceased to exist physically but has persisted in various forms such as social, resident, and architectural. This study mainly focuses on the formation of the Beauty World, examining the urban, social, and cultural contexts that molded the Beauty World Market in unique ways throughout the age. However, in this 21th century, the malls on the site (Beauty World Centre, Bukit Timah Shopping Mall and Beauty World Plaza) are in limbo, with the prospect of demolition or em-bloc. Hence, I was seeking for strategies to retrofit the existing building as new uses without dismantling or reconstructing it during my thesis research. It was intended to reintroduce the vibrancy of the previous Beauty World Market to the site in order to evoke and sustain the Beauty World Market’s ethos by restoring the site’s historical, social, and communal significance. Adaptive reuse tactics provide a few of the original building’s features a second chance at life. ',

It also encourages the replacement of damaged and inefficient structures with sustainable urban typologies that use renewable energy technology to achieve net zero performance. These new programs and architecture are supported by an active landscape, which improves permeability, green links, and storm-water management to lessen the impact of floods, the urban heat island (UHI) effect, and other environmental issues.

      'Home for the Arts 2.0 (Huo Yujia) is a conscientious and robust response to the recent untimely and unceremonious demise of The Substation, Singapore’s pioneering ground-up art space. Informed by intensive research into the roots of community-led art spaces before the dominance of state-sponsorship and control, it asks the fundamental question ‘What should an independent arts space that does not centre on state funding, look like? The thesis proposes the adaptation of Tan Boon Liat Building, an iconic 1970s flatted factory, into a mixed-use arts incubator space with studios, residences, auction house, galleries, markets, topped by a boutique arts hotel enveloped within an overarching sharing and collaborative ecology. ‘Stacks’ with surgical remodelling are created to accommodate the segments within the TBLC. Located at the fringe of Tiong Bahru estate, there is high potential for the site to become a new city fringe urban anchor, and an unfettered ‘Home for the Arts’. ',
    abstract: [
      'With the announcement of the permanent closure of The Substation, the artistic community lost its former home. Nevertheless, under the current context of the global city’s Renaissance City Plan, they still need another platform to nurture local talents beyond the mainstream. The frequent emergence of art spaces in industrial buildings suggests the feasibility of reinventing “A Home for the Arts.” In addition, with the rapid development of science and technology, the specialization trend in industrial buildings has led to the increasing vacancy rate of those ageing ones. Given the scarcity of land in Singapore, revitalizing multi-storey industrial buildings is still necessary. ',
      'As a private-owned flatted factory, Tan Boon Liat Building’s design flexibility hints at its rich possibilities — where art practices may take root. Therefore, the interior space is re-divided under the premise of maintaining the original building structure as much as possible, new programmes are introduced, and the site is redesigned using the original parking lots. In addition to artist studios, art-related programmes such as art market, art school, art auction, conservation, and logistics are introduced, which not only promotes art production but also promotes art consumption so that the independent artists and art groups could be self-sufficient to maintain their artistic practice. A hotel and a hostel are also introduced, and some of the original furniture shops in the building are kept to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem: generating long-term income and exposure for the artists and art groups while also bringing a unique artistic experience to the public.',

The Jalan Kukoh public housing neighbourhood is considered one of Singapore's poorest areas, but the idea takes the opposite approach by preserving the current community, economically strengthening them, and empathetically restoring their dignity as equal citizens in rich and democratic Singapore.

Chin Swee will be given a new heartbeat that rekindles the community spirit and instils a sense of identity through togetherness in scaffolding for opportunities and working hard for better lives. ',

The demonstrative project is underpinned by a strong sense of social justice, and convincingly argues that urban villages can, and should be viably revitalised and transformed to continue providing the essential life support to the city, while preserving their autonomy and sustaining the social structure and fabric. A new mixed use taxi drivers’ amenity centre cum logistic hub anchors the urban village as the main ‘gateway’ building connected to the metropolis, while housing blocks undergo different degrees of intervention to improve liveability and conviviality. Compact high-rise ‘sharing towers’ are carefully inserted into strategic ‘urban acupoints’ to redefine and expand the public realm that is lacking currently.  The scheme demonstrates potential scalability and applicability for the depleting stock of urban villages in Shenzhen to achieve urban rehabilitation and socio-economic progress. ',

Shixia Village is picked as a site for demonstration. Through reprogramming and spatial intervention, the scheme proactively conserves and strengthens the village’s urban quality as well as social landscape, while ensuring economic profitability, living quality, and sustainability. The incorporation of new technologies like automated delivery systems and urban farming technologies improves spatial and production efficiency. In this sense, urban villages not only support the rest of the city as nodes of an invisible infrastructural network. It can offer an alternative way of working and living, nourished from the past, no less than the massively produced “modern norm”.',

      '“Citizen” traces its etymological roots to Latin “civitas”. The city, abstracted to its purest state, is the setting for habitation: it belongs to its people and is bound by the inextricable, symbiotic relationship between city and citizen. Over decades of extreme urban zoning, we have observed an exodus of inhabitants flocking away from the urban core towards sub-urban nodes in the periphery—like a soul uprooted from the body. Furthermore, residential projects that do exist in the city-centre are either luxury private housing or exclusive public housing that leaves out historically marginalised groups, including single parents, LGBT couples, and singles. How can high-density, low-cost housing remedy the inadequacies of public systems? ',

      'The research of Nadia into the cheongsam has uncovered the underlying structure and symbolism of the traditional dress. This serves as the design direction for a centre for upholding various craft traditions in Singapore. The use of the undulating landscape with functional elements embedded allows the flow of space to signify the importance of crafts in the continuum of tradition. The understated connection to the historic school has also helped to showcase the modernist architecture of the school.',
    abstract: [
      'The cheongsam is often associated with impressions of timeless elegance and refined beauty. However, these impressions are often soured by the misconception that one needs to have an hourglass figure to look good in a cheongsam. Yet, whether a cheongsam looks good on a woman depends on the tailors’ skills, not the woman’s body. Sadly, this bespoke craft element of the cheongsam is largely hidden underneath the fabric which perpetuates misconceptions, contributing to the steady decline of the cheongsam tailoring craft. ',
      'Hence, this thesis aims to create a new avenue of engagement for craft through drawing parallels between fashion and architecture. Located nearby the former San Shan Chinese School at Mount Sophia, the intervention is envisioned as a journey of rediscovery through the poche spaces of the site defined by the interaction between the continuous canopy and an undulating ground plane. By activating the poche space: architecture’s equivalent of fabric allowances, with interactive programmes based on traditional craft processes while doubling as the main circulation space, it aims to give opportunities for tailors and craft enthusiasts to interact. ',
      'Consequently, the poche space effectively ‘unearths’ the hidden, elusive nature of craft while giving visitors a literal and symbolic new perspective of craft from the other side (or underside) of the continuous canopy (the fabric) to rediscover and appreciate the typically unseen craft aspects. By blending traditional craft with a modern perspective, it hopefully gives traditional craft new life withstanding the test of time.',

      'Tourism economies are portrayed to be beneficial and profitable to indigenous people residing in cities. However, oversight for the long haul that focuses more on keeping up with globalisation may lead to issues on the displacement of local communities and cultural dilution. Thus, the phenomenon of gentrification inevitably contributes to the physical, social and cultural degradation of a city.',
      'Situated in Yogyakarta City, its art and cultural significance contributes to the city’s identity through tourism which remains instrumental to the economy. Modernisation and globalisation efforts to keep up with rising demands poses a question to the upkeep and advancement of the city’s original culture and communities. Here, the resulting gentrification is evidently seen as having irrevocably deteriorated the presence of local people and folklore.',
      'Glocal City seeks to balance the relationship between globalisation and localisation in order to keep the city alive and relevant in the 21st Century by helping tourism reach a larger pool of audience and economic gain while safekeep authenticity and uniqueness of the city. It focuses on reshaping tourism not just as an alternative source of revenue, but also to enhance the authentic sociocultural values seen in the city, by updating traditions with modern solutions. It is also to capitalise on the already thriving sector and expand opportunities for local people and culture to take part and participate in building their economy.',

Antithetical to the norm of success as being commeasurable with global standards, this thesis imagines tourist destinations to be enwrapped by architecture and activities that speak tacitly and is an overflow from the city’s local culture and humble way of life.',

People attempt to solve this problem, they started to develop tourism in the village, and it has become the fastest-growing industry in rural China. ',

The residential housing forms the organisational system by which its inhabitants would conform to. The established system worked when it needed to. That is, until the outbreak of COVID-19.',

The autonomy of the home can no longer retain its status quo.',

Citizens are led through a series of sequential steps, starting with highly abstract form-making and ending with detailed design decisions concerning construction materials and detailing. In each step, citizens generate large numbers of design proposals that are then analysed in order to extract common patterns, as a starting point for the next step.',

      'In the quest for urbanisation, Singapore has cleared massive areas of primary and secondary forest, leaving us with fragmented nature reserves scattered around the country. We reaped the benefits of deforestation while nature bore the cost of it, benefitting 100% of residents who now reside in urban areas. While there are indeed benefits of urbanisation to humans, many has come to a common consensus that our actions have drastically impacted our ecology negatively. High carbon footprint per capita, high urban heat island effect, and loss of vegetation are just one of the many negative by-products of our actions. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 was formulated to reverse the consequences of our actions through focusing on sustainable development and long-term net zero emissions. Planting of trees, allocating more green spaces, and implementing innovation green solutions and systems to buildings to lower our carbon footprint are some strategies to reverse consequences of our actions. However, there are limitations and scepticism to the success of our green plan. There are many built up areas in Singapore with low biomass, meaning that there is a lack of greenery in the area. Singapore plans to allocate 9% of our land area for parks and nature reserves by 2030, which means that the remaining 91% of our land area is still fully urbanised. With the correct strategies, the 91% urbanised area have the potential to transform into a green hub. With the various stakeholders present in many areas in Singapore, a form of integrative greening approach could be adopted, creating interactions between stakeholders and nature, creating new planting strategies through architecture and community engagement. This thesis proposes the possibility of greening dense urban area of Waterloo Street as a testbed, creating various cojoined spaces between human and nature, and if successful, be propagated to other parts of Singapore. This increased intimacy between urban and nature could allow us to experience the numerous benefits of constantly being in a microclimate created by nature. This thesis idea strives to give back as much ‘land’ to nature as possible, where humans can learn to give up certain areas in exchange for a new way of life in a green-filled environment alongside nature in a new eco-centric city model.

Purification and reclamation of water require energy and it is a waste to use portable water to perform services such as cleaning the streets and watering the plants. As such, localized rain water harvesting in the city for non-portable use will be an essential approach to enhance our water management and energy conservation. Instead of storing the rain water in an hidden underground tank, Anthea aims to incorporate rain water harvesting and its treatment as an external architectural feature that improves and enlivens the city. This is a commendable approach.',
    abstract: [
      'This thesis attempts to push the idea of water sustainability in Singapore beyond the applications of our National Water Taps to strive for a more water sensitive city; one that is adaptive, with multi-functional infrastructure and urban design that is resilient to climate change. It proposes a water storage system that pushes how stormwater can be further collected and retained, to reduce pressure on the water grid for a more energy-efficient future where water for non-potable needs can be collected for use locally instead of being pumped out of site to be treated before use. Furthermore, water has always been a congregation spot, a place for people to gather and for nature to thrive. Hence, the proposal attempts to externalise the water collection and storage process, to re-choreograph and enliven the urban city experience. This brings the culture of water back into the public realm, where people can make full use of water as a source of entertainment, unlike hidden underground tanks that are currently present. Using the idea of a WaterCell that can be replicated onto other districts, this decentralised system focuses on cleaning water through a more organic process. In a country where we are surrounded by water but are rather distant with our water sources, this socio-technical endeavour can re-centralise water at the heart of the way in which cities and urban spaces are laid out and open the potential for us to live with water in the face of a more uncertain climatic future.',

    abstract: [
      'As the world’s population growth approaches the peak of its sigmoid curve, the exigency in the re-evaluation of the incumbent methods of food provision has become ever more apparent. While seaborne, airborne, and road-based transport have been the predominant methods of food freight, the burgeoning of the Belt and Road Initiative has engendered a myriad of infrastructural improvements in rail-based trade networks, reopening the possibility of the distribution of fresh farm produce by rail. Amongst the zeitgeist of sustainability in the current milieu, rail freight presents itself as both a desirable alternative for the diversification of food provision as well as to improve the lives of various stakeholders involved in the supply chain. In the backdrop of the wide ranges of disruptive intermodal transfer as well as vulnerability to covid disruption inherent in the incumbent food logistics chain, the reintroduction of rail-based freight bears the potential to proffer solutions to the above predicaments.',
      'This thesis would thus attempt to explore a new urban typology that can streamline the process of rail-based food import, creating filtering shells that outline spaces for urban vibrancy while not only meeting the requirements for food provision, but injecting elements of fun into the process as well. The incumbent long-winded distribution chain is reimagined as an integrated system where the transport vehicle itself serves as a part of the market for consumers to directly source their food. As such, the system of food distribution and retail becomes integrated with the infrastructure and cadastral patterns of the city, incorporating the market with elements of fun and whimsicality, while remaining highly adaptable and flexible to respond to future contingencies.',

      'Amidst the incontrovertible rising sea levels resulting from global climate change, Syazwan’s thesis recentres the amphibious architecture and spatial practices that have supported the Orang Laut’s centuries-long lifestyle and culture as a resilient model for adaptation. It concurrently explores the creation of alternative economies and settlements along the increasingly derelict shorelines of Batam scarred by industrialisation. In so doing, the architectural project incisive critique on the region’s political economy surfaces socioeconomic vulnerabilities of marginalised communities, and the disastrous environmental upheaval exacerbated by unsustainable industry-led development and urban growth, a consequence of inequitable transnational trade partnerships in the region. ',
    abstract: [
      'The Orang Laut have persisted for over five centuries, utilising their intimate knowledge of the Bays and Capes to create a way of life that is in sync with the natural cycles of the Riau Islands. Their intangible, indigenous knowledge, which has allowed for their constant adaptability, has slowly shifted to work against their favour in recent times. Seen as "backwards" in the eyes of the modern state whose priority was rapid development, the traditionally based Orang Laut saw a gradual increase in marginalization which started to result in loss of territories and livelihood. The coasts which were reclaimed to site various manufacturing and production industries, now stand desolate in the face of mass investor departure. The resultant urban fabric, a terrain of densely packed, juxtaposing typologies built on low-lying land, is now increasingly susceptible to sea-level rise. ',
      "As it stands, 1,700,000 Riau Islanders are at risk of being displaced by the accelerating sea-level rise in Batam. The existing fragile infrastructure will cease to function along with the overcrowding of already high-density urban forms whose inhabitants are predominantly living in poverty. This would be further exacerbated by the highly polluted nature of Batam's waters which possess the potential to devastate more of the populace through the proliferation of waterborne contaminants and diseases. Now faced with an impending crucible moment, the mainlanders - who saw themselves as moral superiors to the Orang Laut - look to them for salvation from the rising seas.",
      'Learning from centuries-old, vernacular knowledge could offer new typology alternatives that can both adapt to a dynamic and fluid base such as water, and has a low barrier of entry to ensure the gradual inclusivity of the majority.  As a result of its rapid development, the Batam industrial landscape is rife with remnants of the now-defunct manufacturing industries, with plastic barrels, unused processed materials and incomplete ship sections dotting the coasts. Could the discarded remnants of a once hopeful age be given new life as the building blocks of a new coastal typology that draws upon and recognizes the invaluable knowledge of the marginalized indigenous Orang Laut? One that celebrates adaptability, environmental affordance and a circular economy. This thesis proposes to view the shipyards as a new material resource, in place of dwindling natural ones, which is slowly broken down and converted into floating infrastructure that is informed by the key tenets of indigenous knowledge in a bid to provide for an alternative, more resilient urban typology.',

      'De Quan’s project invites us to ponder the possibility of a self-regulated city where architects and planners design open structures that invite participatory action. Following Peter Sloterdijk’s conception of the human as inherently relational and spatially determined, this thesis project proposes a structure both physical and relational that reimagines the Singapore public housing as a system both formal and informal, participative and planned. He explores his concept of “foams” at multiple scales ranging from furniture systems, to unit systems to precinct, neighbourhood and districts.',
    abstract: [
      'Singapore is governed by strict, overbearing policies aimed at creating fragile peace through placid stability within its society. Through the lens of “Foams”, the value of this disingenuous harmony is questioned, embracing disruption and conflict as alternative societal values which creates a new state of living and dwelling which allows for vibrancy and cohesivity. “Foams” is used as a lens of framing temporal, unstable state of communities formed today, as well as concepts such as autonomy, Game Theory, and self-organization explicated by Brazil’s favelas and the micropolitics of community gardens in Singapore, a new framework of urbanism which allows for a hybrid top-down and bottom-up approach to design is established. Situating the foam city within the context of Paya Lebar Air Base, the creation of foam cities is examined.',
      'In Peter Sloterdijk’s book, “Foams”, he uses the metaphor of the foam to describe societal relations formed today. Foams depict a complex matrix consisting of highly interdependent, self-immunizing “bubbles”, taking on an unstable and temporal state. Communities formed today resemble these “bubbles”, in a state of instability, repeatedly merging, forming, inflating, and bursting. Ever-shifting socio-political and urban landscapes imbue a sense of hyper-awareness of one’s living environment, allowing for differences to be exacerbated and conflict to occur. Studying case studies of self-organizing communities both within and outside of Singapore’s context, a pattern of rules and interactions are revealed. Within favelas such as those in Brazil, self-regulated communities abide by unspoken rules of organization, such as the spacing between houses and window views that are non-intrusive to one’s neighbors. Unspoken social relations and urban etiquette exist within the context of Singapore as well, manifesting itself as spaces of exclusion and isolation intrinsically or extrinsically.',

The painstakingly rendered visual panels belie Hui Zhi’s admirable efforts to depict a truthful palimpsest of this diverse riverside neighbourhood, based on facts and memories distilled from detailed surveys conducted on almost fifty respondents. Informed by unique emic perspectives of new and long-time residents of Hougang from different age groups, the project addresses a lacuna on the big and difficult questions concerning Singapore’s future. ',
    abstract: [
      '“Momento Mori” is a reminder of mortality - everything will eventually die. Similarly, Singapore’s built environment faces the inevitable destine for ruin, removal, and change because of our pragmatic approach towards development. Space-making is curated through a non-linear palimpsest, which comprises layers and traces from a multiplicity of contexts, both spatial and temporal. Yet, they are slammed with singular, cliché state narratives, which often discount the nuanced micronarratives of the people that inhabited the place and its ‘spirit’.',
      'Since the 1970s, there has been a boom in scholarship on memory studies which are traditionally centred around the human mind. Even in the field of architecture, it has been limited to what has been outlined in the Art of Memory (Frances Yates, 1966) – which conceptualizes the brain as a physical space that stores memories like how one stores objects in the room. Hence, this thesis argues that architecture can have memories by examining it with the most influential memory model, the Multi-Store Model (MSM) (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968). It proposes that memory consists of three stores: a sensory register, short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) and that information is transferred between these stores. Acknowledging that this model is an oversimplification of the memory-making process, it provides a foundation for deeper inquiry of architecture’s memory-making processes through the stories of its people. ',
      'Unlike the state’s one-size-fits-all approach, this thesis aims to develop a more humanistic framework for future city planning through Architectural Ethnography and drawing as a process. This is to uncover the unseen realities of its landscape, like its intangible heritage, frictionless co-existence, and the palimpsest of lived experiences. Using Hougang as a testbed for this framework, it serves to inspire critical thought about our future landscape through imaginative reconstruction by depicting a landscape of festivity.',

      'Huiyao proposes a novel approach to the participatory design of residential high-rise apartments. In contrast to previous approaches, she focuses on the ability of residents to modify and resize their apartments throughout the lifetime of the building. Her approach is enabled by a highly flexible modular construction system coupled with a digital web platform for designing apartments. Each resident can use the web app to buy spatial cells within the 3D structural grid, and then design their own customized apartment, specific to their needs and desires. Over time, they can also grow and shrink their apartment, in response to changes in their lifestyle. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, Huiyao developed a fully functional 3D web application for designing apartments. You can view the web app at: https://huiyaohu.github.io/thesis-in-progress/.',

      'Houses on the Cloud is a web-based residential participatory design platform scripted using JavaScript (3JS Library), CSS and HTML. The app prototype is supported by a theoretical construction system of prefabricated modules that allows customisation of both the interior and exterior configurations of the apartment by the residents continuously over the lifetime of the building.',
      'Despite significant shifts in values and family compositions of the new generations in some now developed Asian nations, most modern-day high-rise residences still share the same legacy layouts, designed for ideal nuclear families with regular work life patterns. The proposed participatory design framework explores alternative visions of adaptable housing solutions to overcome the issues of homogeneity and limited variability. It is enabled by the open building concept: the support being a concrete frame into which apartments are inserted as infills. The web application is designed using a gamified approach, making it easy for non-designers to create 3D models of their apartments.',
      'The proposal challenges the concept of a building: it is no longer a static entity, but instead a dynamic process that will undergo continuous adaptation through participatory design. The role of an architect focuses more on being a designer of spatial rules rather than the designer of a final spatial form.',

      'Species extinction is linked to urban expansion. From that simple premise, this thesis attempts to create an Ecotone within an urban setting, defined as a space where two ecological conditions overlap. It starts with a critique of land use in Singapore, specifically, golf courses. The proposal blurs the boundary between architecture and landscape, urban and natural, capturing moments when the two worlds intersect. At the regional scale, the scheme defragments ecosystems, linking two ecologically rich parts of the island with a new forest-park, repurposed from golf courses, and creating new amenities that are easily accessible by residents of nearby residential areas.',
    abstract: [
      'Earth is facing its sixth extinction of species. For this to cease, humans need to [a] reduce consumption of resources that deplete natural systems [b] regenerate habitats and reconnect fragmented biodiversity hotspots [c] preserve genetic material of species at risk, and [d] foster activism on nature conservation. Cities are a key part of this solution. They must be designed with biodiversity in mind, since urban growth is largely responsible for the unprecedented biodiversity loss of 68 percent in less than half a century .',
      'In Singapore, several strategies are in place to create a nature-centric city, one that permits a symbiotic relationship between nature and human-made . However, an analysis of Singapore’s nature conservation plan shows insufficient consideration. For instance, nature is not prioritised over human needs and, as a result, ecosystems are fragmented and isolated. Green spaces in Singapore focus on anthropocentric needs, such as leisure or the reduction of Urban Heat Index (UHI).',
      'Within Singapore’s cityscape, there are two distinct categories. The first is human-centric, i.e. built elements that satisfy housing, roads, etc. The second is nature-centric, i.e. nature reserves, wetlands, mangroves, etc. which are preserved for biodiversity. This thesis proposes a third space that creates room for both. Based on the concept of an Ecotone, this will be a transitional space between two adjacent ecological systems , between the first and second space types. It will contain habitats and programmes that support both urban and ecological needs.',
      'This proposed Ecotone, creates spaces that allow human-wildlife interactions to be possible but ensuring safety for both parties. These new forms of interactions are crucial towards forming empathy towards animals, a step crucial towards changing the future. This space will also include cryogenic labs, making it possible to revive endangered animals, returning them to their habitats.',

      "Adaptive Strategies for Future Rural Villages of Bangladesh: Impacts of Sea Level Rise explores adaptive strategies for future rural villages of Bangladesh as a result of sea-level rise and climate change. The research into the evolution of rural Bangladesh housing has framed knowledge on the essential requirements of achieving a resilient, adaptive design at the housing unit scale. The unit scale entangles the development of villages, agricultural areas, and larger territories. The research illustrates the current shift from paddy farming to shrimp farming, impacting peri-urban and architectural formation. The design acknowledges that architecture and resilient housing alone cannot uplift the people's livelihood; instead, it is the collective considerations between both architecture and the entire social territory that enables a community to thrive alongside climate change.",

      'Bangladesh is a country that is vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the rising of sea levels, due to the country’s geographical typography, being flat and low-lying. With the encroachment of seawater inland, this has resulted in the endangerment of housing, food security, and the well-being of individuals. As a result, the government along with multiple NGOs have assisted in providing rural villages with various flood-resistant housing designs over the last decade in attempts to improve the lifestyle of affected communities. Although sea-level rise poses a threat towards rural housings, from my investigations and research into the climatic impacts experienced within these rural villages located in district Khunla, I have come to realize that it is the climatic threat towards the profitable farmlands that have instilled immense suffering upon these rural communities. Therefore, architecture and resilient housings alone are not enough to sustain the livelihood of these villages. Instead, it is through this collective consideration of both architecture as well as the entire social territory of these rural villages, that enable new innovative solutions to emerge, allowing for improved adaptive approaches towards community lifestyles that can thrive alongside climate change.

From the Natural (the beauty of trees, the sense of mysticality in forests, and the sacredness they protect), to the Mechanical (reality of industrialization, rapid destruction of environment, never-ending pursuit of economical growth), the disconnection between them and outlooks for our future grew more and more pessimistic. However, with enough despair in the world right now, what we need is not another dystopian future filled with warnings. But rather, finding the magic and love towards our environment, and a sense of optimistic vision towards a viridescent future we one day may have. ',
      'Presenting a hyper-naturalized Singapore from a viridescent future, Bionic City explore an integrative way of architectural hybridization between both natural and mechanical systems in the pursuit of a reconnection to the magic of nature. Inspired by the fictional plots and aesthetics from Studio Ghibli’s animation films, conflicts between human, machines, and nature, the search for reconciliation between forces from both sides, seeking peace within wars. It is appreciating the ‘both.. and…’, exploring the many layers in the relationships between all factors. With Nature being the dominant design driver in this speculative construct, it follows the juxtaposition of the atmospheric beauty of nature together with the mechanistic order of profit and loss, shifting this relationship of transactional to giving and receiving through a series of collisions and coalescence between Nature and humans. Tapping upon the idea of soft fascination, as a way to recover the poetry and beauty that is lost, and to rekindle our innate love and curiosity for nature once again. Local energy grids, local solutions, autonomous functioning systems, makers culture, being a resident as well as a caretaker, Bionic City also provide opportunities to examine the circular relationships we can have with nature through creative ways within the neo-viridescent living conditions.

      'Architecture, according to the ideas set out by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book “Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder” is anything but antifragile. Re-examining the traditional tenets of architecture in a post-Covid19 world, Lin Chin’s investigation into a different definition of our discipline is timely, necessary and thought-provoking. Centered around concepts of plasticity, self-organisation and crowd authorship, Lin Chin’s thesis design implored for a reset in design methodology, building material, re-calibration of place, time in hopes of arriving at a plausible new zeitgeist where architect, site, order, form etc. are systematically deconstructed and a new paradigm arises as an even more formidable way of architectural thinking and where design may transcend materiality.',

Antifragility is a concept coined by Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile, where he discussed how some things flourish when exposed to stressors. We know for fact that fragile is not good, but in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, it is no longer enough to just be resilient because we do not just want to return to the same state after every stressor; we want to gain from and emerge better from them. Simply put, the concept of antifragility is two parts: first, the presence of a stressor and second, the need to transform to surmount and thrive under the stressor. This thesis postulates the fundamental principles of antifragility in the field of architecture are as follows:',

The architect does not design architecture per se, but simply the systems in which these emergent architectural forms thrive. The second semester kicked off via taking a materialist approach, as the various emergent forms of paraffin wax, a substantial by-product of petroleum refining, are investigated, documented and their implications materialized. This thesis is set in point in time in the future when debilitating climate change has made floods a frequent occurrence in many low lying areas in Singapore, and one such neighborhood particularly affected is Tanjong Katong. Two interventions, The Hybrid Street Lamps and The Emergent Flood Relief Center are proposed on two nearby sites in Tanjong Katong, each taking a different approach to antifragility.',

      'Heritage conservation in the current world is usually achieved through the rigorous review of heritage conservation guidelines by experts and the authorities. The application of this guidelines are rigid and are only applicable to buildings already gazetted under conservation status. This approach of achieving heritage conservation by focusing on guidelines for individual buildings did managed to conserve quite an amount of buildings, but the incomplete view on the greater system behind heritage conservation and the negligence of the surrounding context of a heritage site had resulted in a singular-narrative of the heritage building that is static and resulted in a focus on facadism and selective conservation that is slow to response to changes in development. The thesis proposes an innovative participatory design approach in dealing with issues of heritage conservation. The proposed idea calls for a redistribution of power among planning authorities, developers and citizens through a method of co-design and co-decision. Through the layering of virtual architectural information and the physical architectural environment, the thesis provides citizens with a tool that empowers them to think critically of their built environment and to initiate design development in their own city. Through the implementation of a web application prototype, the thesis aims to aid in community building and to provide a more accurate positioning of design issues in relation to its users by turning the citizens into active guardians of their very own cultural and architectural heritage.',

As Singapore’s limited land space struggles to keep up with the needs of the growing population, the conflict between Singapore’s urban development and its environmental preservation is called into question. To date, Singapore has lost nearly 99% of its natural forest cover with substantial environmental consequences such as biodiversity loss, increased flood risk, and rising temperatures. Yet, more of Singapore’s forested areas such as Tengah Forest will be cleared to make way for urban infrastructures such as housing developments and transport infrastructures. ',

At the same time, it looks at the possible integration of a columbarium space with existing depots in Singapore as a study to free up existing columbarium for other developments which are often contested in land scarce Singapore, to look beyond monofunctional infrastructure and its current tokenistic nature of greening solution, as a network of systems to encourage a symbiotic relationship between man and nature.',

The thesis explores a future where the threat of sea-level rise becomes an opportunity to deploy flood mitigation design and floating habitats to reconnect residents to the sea and recover the city-state\'s sense of "islandness". The thesis advances an architectural expression unique to the new lifestyles, skills, habits, and culture of living on the water.\n',
    abstract: [
      'Noted in a volume of the Island Institute, it is the geographical circumstances of different natures that the islanders feel deeply affiliated to. It strongly attributes to the “islandess” of their identity, both as individuals and as a community . At the wake of globalisation, long-standing indigenous communities and traditions which were inherent in island identities are slowly being displaced by urbanisation and rapid fluctuation of population growth. The loss of this sense of islandness is tied to an eroding perception of islandness in Singapore as Singapore continues to urbanise and flourish. In 5 years’ time, a major ice shelf in West Antartica known as the Doomsday Glacier is set to shatter causing a block-chain ice breakage that will result in an increase from 1 metre by 2100 to a 1.8 metre to 3 metre by the end of the century. In light of this existential threat of the rise in sea levels coupled with the overwhelming increase in levels once Doomsday Glacier has shattered, Singapore will lose 30% of its lands in a much shorter time. The thesis explores a future Singapore where the existential threat of sea-level rise becomes an opportunity to deploy flood mitigation designs at different scales as a strategy to recover the city-state’s “sense of islandness”. Set in a future year of 2070, and the entire East Coast as a test bed, it serves to incite and invoke a possible future where the existing coast line is reshaped according to its levels with mangrove and beach restoration to mitigate costal floods; low-lying inlands areas are carved out to form playful water terminal and the displaced population of Marine Parade and Mountbatten will be the pioneer generation of Singapore’s islanders. Through this thesis, it aims to bring to light an urgent future, and mitigate it through a series of flood mitigating strategies to recover, create and enhance a synergistic relationship of water and the sea.',

      'Meaning and Gardening \nIn our capitalist world, should we be rethinking measures of success and happiness? This project takes cues from emergent calls for more responsible and empathetic ways of living.\nPrecipitated by the post covid gardening boom, the project explores the possibility where a semi agrarian populace emerges from the urbanites, in a collective response to the problems of high capitalism and environmental threats. It imagines a series of interconnected extended villages on top HDB flats existing alongside mainstream Singapore society.  They form a parallel community, to live in a way that addresses the major issues of the day – environmental sustainability, food sustainability, energy scarcity and the loss of empathy and mental well-being.\nIt hints at the possibility of how Singapore may look like if it develops into a more heterogenous and diverse society.  One where differences in values, lifestyles and definitions of happiness, fragments the population into smaller, but complementary & overlapping communities based on shared ideals.\n',

      'The Green “Party” is an exploration of a prominent “chapter” within a larger collection of “new happiness narratives” in Singapore. Seeking to uncover how Singaporeans are beginning to react to the present monotheistic “national narrative”, by imparting physical and cultural changes within the typical neighbourhood, it tries to embody the country’s many existing “hacks of happiness”, and translates them into lifestyles of the future that revolves around the more sustainable, self-dependable and altruistic values of these Singaporeans. By turning to urban farming as a way to impart change in the built environment, as well as a way to give back to the community with donations and sustainable resources, these people aim to create communities centred around that set of beliefs. The proposal hence projects a tangible way for one to “grow” and “cultivate” their happiness, all from a simple act of planting in their neighbourhood.',

This project seeks to buck the trend by exploring how we can learn from traditions, specifically traditions that seeks to be in harmony with the natural environment, taking from nature without destroying and depleting our environment. A series of progressively varying architecture that engages both land and sea and seeks to occupy this ever-changing threshold facilitates new ways of living and trading.

      'How do we find a new normal in an ever-deteriorating climate environment? This thesis speculates that while there are concerted global efforts to address climate changes, there must also be local attempts to learn and live with the inevitable impact of such changes. Jeslyn’s exploration into living with the rising sea levels proffers not only a new physical reality of living on water but also attempt to exploit the new physical environment to shape an equally new and egalitarian social structure. Can places and spaces modify and moderate not only how we live, but also how we think, behave and govern? The family of architectural solutions pushes the boundaries of essential living and toiling while forging social platforms for new ways of community interaction and integration. The goal is a new community that is as flat as the water it floats on.',

The effects of climate change are irreversible and humans should not resist these changes, but instead, accept and embrace the new normal conditions of living with the land and sea.',
      'Set in the Year 2050, the thesis aims to reimagine an alternate reality of Muara Gembong, one that is freed from the reins of the government and where a new urban and social order is defined. Akin to the idea of a plug-and-play lego concept, the making of the new village is proposed through the implementation of a set of modular key parts that can be assembled and configured in any way, creating infinite possibilities of arrangements, and still be connected to one another. Local residents are given the freedom and power to be in charge of choreographing their own spaces according to their lifestyles and preferences, ultimately creating a continuum of spaces and programs that are part of an interconnected network of mobile communities that promotes a culture of sharing and collective decision-making.',

With a melding of natural occurrences with increasingly artificial interventions, how do we discern between the two? Have we instead long found ourselves accustomed to a nature of a hybrid ecosystem?  Singapore’s long trajectory of commandeering nature for nationalistic goals, offers a case study in increasing human hubris of propping up the liveability of nature through technological interventions. Have we however, stopped to consider the unintended, non-designed impacts of these interventions? While it has only grown ever important to be cognizant of the state of Nature around us, we seem to be suffering a shifting baseline syndrome made ever difficult with a national practice of ‘making clean’ in a bid to create a single, homogenous story.',

The current system is reimagined from a land-use perspective, overlaying food production, distribution and waste handling onto the existing MRT network. Here, the mono-functionalism of large MRT depots in Singapore is questioned. A proposal for an urban farm within Bishan Depot carves out space for high-rise farms and underground logistics, linked to an MRT line that carries food to communities in the north and centre of the island.

The design proposal aims to reimagine a food system in Singapore that addresses these underlying problems: increasing local food production, reducing food wastage and introducing food waste recovery. The Bishan Food Depot reimagines Singapore’s Food System as a decentralised food production network that is integrated with the existing MRT network, creating smaller closed loop networks that boosts Singapore’s local food production and introduces a decentralised food waste recovery system.',

      'Beyond Multiple Choice offers an entryway into a novel mode of architecture practice in Singapore. This project seeks to question if civic engagement with residents can go beyond current limited approaches, such as multiple-choice polls for paint colour schemes on public housing facades. Singapore’s urban development occurs through the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), and the Housing and Development Board (HDB), which have incredible power. Urban policies and transformations tend to happen to residents, rather than with them, due to opaque urban policies, and prescriptive master plans. The book entitled Toa Payoh: Our Kind of Neighbourhood (2000), is most evident of this process. A 40th anniversary publication by the HDB, the book documents stories by long-time residents of the New Town of Toa Payoh, and how their lives have been influenced by state-led visions of a modern, urban future. This book, which is central to my project, reflects how the architect in Singapore typically designs with the state as the client. Civic communities tend to play minor supporting roles, if at all, despite being the main users of the created public spaces and apartments. In response, I position myself as an architect, that seeks to mediate an alternate process of urban transformation, one that exists in agonism with the URA and HDB. I ask, can Toa Payoh resident’s lived space narratives shape the future of the estate? Toa Payoh is the oldest New Town planned by URA and HDB. In approximately 20 years, the first of the public housing blocks in Toa Payoh will reach year 70 of their 99-year leases, which is when the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) will begin. Around 2040, homeowners will vote to decide whether to return the housing before the lease runs out and resettle nearby, or to stay in place until the end of the lease. Beyond Multiple Choice mobilizes this multiple-choice moment in redevelopment towards more inclusive and diverse, old-New Town futures. I design inventive approaches to public housing, allowing residents a greater agency in shaping their lives and communal living, beyond that of the nuclear family unit. Drawing from spontaneity that I observed in the New Town, I show how certain parts of a ring road might be closed, and rezoned into a new open category, one that allows for communities’ shared ownership. Overall, I project a spontaneous urban future of Toa Payoh, through both practical and imaginative scenarios of how these transformations might play out.',

The project relates these key spaces through collective pursuits of environmental ‘health’ and ‘wealth’. On the streets, mobile dragon floats collect discarded household objects and sunlight, wind and rain, transforming these elements into education resources, free energy, and a cleaner city. The Guangzhou Train Station turns into a seasonal orchard, producing fresh air, with an abundance of fruiting trees and wild ecology, thus safeguarding the happiness and health of the home-returning travelers.

Hinged between the Sungnyemun Gate and the Namdaemun Market, Bong Jun’s renovation project for the Lotte Insurance Building innovates in its treatment of the typical section.

      ' In the 1927city map, most of the blocks in the historic city centre were depicted as solids because the low-rise, low-density ‘Hanok’ structure was the predominant architectural type in the city centre. However, with the urban redevelopment plan and economic growth after the Korean War, high-density buildings in historic city centres were introduced. Through this process, the urban matrix changed from a continuous solid to a continuous void. High-rise buildings have been separated within the framework of the city, dismantling the existing context using the logic of capitalism. It is an undeniable fact that high-rise buildings are inevitable architectural forms in a city such as Seoul, which has a relatively small land area. By studying the spatial component of the urban matrix, the aim of this thesis is to seek the possibility of reconstructing high-rise architecture with elements of the surrounding context, which will allow the vertical extension of the urban matrix.

A system of devices are designed to assist Mdm Phua in carrying out her daily tasks such as bathing, cooking and caring for house plants while also training mobility and soothing body aches. Four types of body braces work within a system of textile pulley-conveyors. These support Mdm Phua as she moves within three humid zones of varying plant-based microclimates. Each device is made using specific craft skills and assets. Through such acts of (re)making, the process of repair is already occurring, both physically and metaphorically. (Re)making the flat’s interior parallels the mending of relationships to architectural space, thus, reconstituting the role of ‘making-do’ in the lived architecture of the home. ',

His research contribution is in his proposed adapted framework to design for mental\nhealth and his thesis design demonstrates a possible iteration of how high-rise housing can be\ndesigned to improve mental wellbeing at different scales - the interior of semi-outdoor spaces with\ngreenery and views, the floors interconnected by cascading green communal decks and the site plan\nof green and blue elements.',
    abstract: [
      "During the pandemic, the unprecedented and prolong periods of social isolation and lockdowns has negatively impacted many individuals' mental state and well-being. This is largely due to mandatory increase in stay-home-hours and decreased social interaction.  This is noticeably observed in high-rise developments, with the lack of spaces provided for people to recharge in living with the stressful pandemic life. This includes the overcrowding of their homes unique to this pandemic in the work-from-home (WFH) and home-based-learning (HBL) arrangement. ",
      'Thus, this thesis project seeks to recreate the physical spaces of high-rise public housing development, using the current building density, to alleviate and improve on the mental well-being of Singaporeans. The design principles centres around the key aspects of biophilia and mental health, as well as salutogenic design, focusing on the sense of coherence of the residents to improve the ability to cope with day-to-day challenges. The design strategies include channelling blue and green natural elements to aid wayfinding and increasing accessibility to refuge spaces scattered throughout the precinct. The increased interaction between residents, neighbours, and natural elements aims to expose users to components beyond the dense physical built environment and provide an alternative means of relief within the high-rise residential development.',

      'This thesis addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic, in the context of public housing in Singapore. In particular, Hui Min seeks to respond to the tensions caused by remote working and learning owing to the blurring of boundaries between work and family life, and the lack of social interaction affecting occupants’ well-being. Her precedent studies highlighted the potential role and contribution of community and public spaces in addressing the stated challenges. Consequently, the Urban Nest sought to rethink the public housing typology through a novel overlapping and linking of housing units with public and communal spaces. It led to smaller and varied discernible communities in vertically stacked clusters, offering users’ choice, convenience, and access to a range of amenities nestled in naturally ventilated green spaces. Flexible and adaptable units with outdoor spaces were integrated in differing ways with a range of multi-scalar community and public spaces to create distinctive environments such as ‘work clusters’, ‘farming clusters’ and so forth. Neighbourhood scale amenities and public spaces were also stratified at strategic levels- ground, intermediate levels and the roof top, with a view to enabling their use and integration in daily life.  The Urban Nest is conceived as a prototype that can be deployed within a precinct to serve the wider neighbourhood, one that is generous and creates opportunities for all.',

      'Since the start of pandemic, many of us are starting to remote work and learn from home, changing the way our homes are used and occupied. This resulted in some issues such as blurred boundaries with work and private life, family tension and reduced social interaction. With that, one in three saw a decline in mental well-being. With the increasing trend of remote work and learning, this provides us an opportunity to rethink our housing typology.',
      'With the constant downsizing of housing units, little flexibility is provided to cater to this new lifestyle trend and impacted the social relationship at home where there is an increasing need for privacy as much as the need for social interaction. Despite the limitation faced within housing units, communal spaces on the other hand have the potential to cater to this change and improve an individual well-being. With that, my public housing project prioritises communal spaces instead of housing units where communal spaces can be designed to better incorporate in our daily life. This new housing typology should not be viewed as a cookie cutting for future housing but instead, as a project that can be found within a precinct with programs and facilities that is generous to the neighbours and create opportunities for all.',

It plays a significant part in our lives not just because it keeps us alive, but because of how we enjoy it. In a food haven such as Singapore, we often take for granted the prevalence of food here that is readily available to enjoy, not knowing where it came from or how to prepare it. This project aims to be a knowledge sharing space, bringing together the community and forming a deeper relationship with food by gaining insight into the different stages of the food cycle and creating a living archival of food knowledge through guidance, interaction and documentation. Through this, our local cuisine can be shared and enjoyed for many generations to come. ',

      'The project Waste Degeneration creatively re-imagines the refuse of Yuhua, a public housing estate in Singapore. The thesis asks, what if various waste streams were revalued as socially and environmentally productive urban elements? Learning from a close study of seven types of existing waste, Xing Ni creatively rethreads each stream into underutilized spaces like an old school, rooftops, and void decks. A large organizing element is a loop, which serves to anchor various nodes for waste reuse into a legible corridor and to bring various estates together through shared, practices of recycling.\n',

      'This project is an inquiry into the relationships between waste, society and the environment in Singapore. With the rapid filling up of Singapore’s one and only landfill, the Semakau Landfill, Singapore currently faces the issue of waste overgeneration. I ask, might architecture address this issue by reconfiguring the relationship between waste, society, and the environmment? I explore this question through a sample neighbourhood of one and a half kilometer square, the Yuhua Estate and its surrounding areas, which are located in the west region of Singapore. According to studies and surveys done amongst residents, it is difficult to minimise residential waste. Some of the main challenges to reducing residential waste in Singapore include lack of recycling knowledge, and the perception that recycling is inconvenient and secondary in a person’s daily routine. Furthermore, there is little incentive to reduce, as residential waste is currently charged at a fixed rate or fee per household regardless of the quantity of waste disposed. I tackle these challenges spatially through three design strategies.  First, I propose an informal pedestrian loop intertwined with void deck spaces to host the various waste-related programs that reduce waste generation in the Yuhua Community. The programs are targeted to manually upcycle or repair residents’ household waste in a convenient and accessible manner. Second, I propose that an old secondary school campus be repurposed into a recycling shelter, and multiple mini incinerators to be located on top of selected residential buildings within the loop to provide a transparent recycling and incinerating process for the residents to see as a way increase waste awareness within the community. Last, I propose an ash-scape within the old secondary school campus that is made of incineration ash and other earth materials to provide residents with mixed-use spaces within the school. ',

Two old shopping malls are chosen to demonstrate the process of this new model which involves adaptively reusing one of the shopping malls to bring about incremental adaptation of the other in carefully managed phases.    Successful application of the new model would result in new economic vitality and regenerated public space integrated with commercial activities. With the new model, adaptive reuse could become a more favourable option to private developers and an important step towards public empowerment. ',

      'A very personal journey by Nigel who took an introspective view of the world around us. What started off as a situationist approach to architecture became a well-researched observational documentary that questioned the very fundamentals of WHO public spaces are designed for? A focus on in-between spaces in the city for the in-between people revealed a layer of community that seeks out spaces where there is non and where they do not belong. But the thesis also revealed the possibilities of tactical urban insertions into the everyday architecture and the possibilities of a parallel world, right in the midst of our city. \n',
    abstract: [
      'Public spaces are usually designed to be vibrant and socially engaging. This thesis considers the alternative: creating spaces designed for Solitude in public realm, as a critique and expansion of the conventional understanding and repertoire of public spaces in the city. From a sociological and psychological perspective, Solitude offers precious freedom. In crowded density, it allows one to disengage from the demands of others: a restorative freedom from social constraints. A depth of connections and levels of engagement, beyond direct interaction. This form of Solitude found in urban density, exists together with the vibrant public space, where the individual is connected but not burdened to participate. On the human scale, the thesis investigates the environmental and somatic conditions necessary to create Solitude. On the urban scale, a prototype “generic city” is formed as a testbed for the hypothesis. From an understanding of the typical urban fabric, behavioural commonalities and temporal patterns that comprise the complex lattice of the city, frameworks are developed to extract potential urban conditions. Subsequently, analysis and designing of the architectural responses to bring out Solitude. Mindful of the highly contested nature of public space, the thesis seeks a means of tactically weaving these spaces into the urban realm. A dual-nature comprising a concerted effort on the scale of a city, yet inherently operating on the intimate, human scale. The thesis thus proposes the conception of a Positive Urban Solitude, a Solitude that exists embedded and connected to the public realm, mediated by architecture.',

Social stratification and ensuing stigma are successfully confronted through introduction of empowered users’ concept and evolutionary design that allows for it. Architectural conception equalizes all residents through providing fair opportunities to have a voice, to share, to construct and creatively contribute to this liveable community.

      'This thesis investigates rediscovering a new way of how architecture is being deployed to negotiate a space of living where an inclusivity society exists within a capitalist-driven country is celebrated. Singapore has observed a rapid progression in the economic growth of its city since its independence. “City in a garden” has become the portrayal of Singapore in the eyes of foreigners. Despite attempts to create a conflict-free environment by densifying the social landscape, it has revealed social tensions between the different social classes in Singapore. The existence of tension may not come within the general area such as home but more of the shared and public spaces such as playgrounds, and open courts between the owner-occupied and rental blocks. As a result, the aforementioned factors can influence how people perceive space—leveraging on creating a community that relies on each other. The strategy was to approach the architecture through adaptive reuse and introducing intergenerational housing within the rental houses. Growing a new target audience also creates a new way of living within the existing community. Utilizing various scales of house type as a tool to blur the social stratification.

The goal of this thesis is to see how we can extrapolate this beyond McDonald’s, by using McDonald’s as a theoretical base. Therefore, Refreshing POPS emphasises not only the economic aspects but also the social and environmental aspects with this new circular management model. This new typology of consumption space that integrates circularity could benefit socially and environmentally through spaces for city transients constructed from food waste materials, and private corporations could benefit economically from more customers and sales from the internal farm’s produce.',

The project learns from the infrastructures of current community garden practices, with a special focus on the ground as a lively fabric that shapes future urban form. In Singapore, cultivation has been demolished, moved to the edges of the city, or relegated to small pockets. The ground is often cultivated as ‘open’ or as a ‘void’. Claiming Ground is hence crucial in claiming the ground anew, and as a space that emerges from community practices. The architect has a role to play in supporting gardeners, as design of both future buildings and landscape often ignores existing cultivation practices as having form-giving power. The project is demonstrated through a close reading of one HDB estate, namely Ang Mo Kio, as this estate has high building density and a large percentage of elderly population, many of whom are gardeners. These characteristics mirror Singapore in general, and other urban places in South East Asia with an aging population. Overall, the project speaks to a desire of many people, not just the elderly, to cultivate their own food and tend a garden in the actual ground.',

      'The Rogue Burn of 2021, which was a protest against the corporatist Burning Man, demonstrated how the breakdown of central care-work activated community members to organically assume care roles in ways that further reinforced long-term relationships between members. This thesis then espouses the designing of community space that seeds care as opposed to a top-down delegation of care-work; an experiment in stewarding care ownership. ',
      'With an ongoing roadmap of extending the Park Connector Network and a slated opening of a highly-anticipated 14,000 sqm fitness SAFRA building, Choa Chu Kang Park is selected as a ripe testbed for the speculation of both ephemeral and permanent communal spaces. Existing communities on-site as well as a proposed outdoor climbing collective are key drivers that utilise the five re-interpreted strategies of spatial care autonomy that give the option of participating, stepping away or branching off from within communities, manifesting in a pilot space of caring and decentralised communities. The resultant anchor-seeding mobile typology seeks to represent decentralised care stewardship in an organic and burgeoning way, exemplifying how individuals can be self-organising custodians of care within a given park setting.',

      'Cohabitation or fear, threat or conviviality with the invisible world of microbes-these are just some of the core questions initiated by this thesis project conveniently nested in times of Covid 19 havoc. With an early consensus on need to live with nature and of nature in order to remain healthy, this project than adopts another challenge-to set the design in a mangrove restoration area. The living domain thus flows into the mangrove delta with its elusive boundaries between the built and the natural, and vice versa, nature takes over the living domain while irrevocably changing the habits of the residents.

      'The thesis explores Singapore’s progressive paradigms of an ideal clean and green global city - the ecological modernisation ideal that Singapore’s urban policy has been developing since 1963: a “Garden City”, “City in a Garden”, and recently, “City in Nature”.',
      'Emergent dynamics have the potential to destabilise the current established order - microbes that cause emergent diseases by discovering new modes of transmission or forms of existence can swiftly change prevailing political policies, economic structures or agricultural practices. The pandemic has demonstrated how spontaneous growth in manicured green spaces has made Singapore more attractive and resilient.',
      'Microbial diversity plays a huge role in the lost biodiversity and is essential for maintaining a balanced ecosystem. As humans are part of this ecosystem, our immune systems will fail to function when the exposure to microbes is reduced or eradicated. There is an urgent need for alternative methods of ecological architecture, a new approach to urban design that treats biodiversity as an opportunity and a valued resource in the built environment. Therefore, this thesis aims to speculate how new typologies can be emerged to recover community resilience through a healthy exposure to bacterial flora even when we spend most of the time indoors, once again fundamentally changing our spatial routines.',

      'This thesis is a narrative about a place where a Chinese woman can exercise her autonomy for deciding about her romance journey. It is a critical and witty reaction to the bizarre and contrived nature of match-making efforts in the anxious contemporary Chinese society. It engages the pertinent drivers by representing them as a composition of counterpoints – self and society, fantasy and realization, virtual and physical, traditional values and contemporary spirit, personal beliefs and cultural myths, sentiment and commercial intent. The value of this architectural outcome is an invention of a breath-taking public place suspended over an unforgiving network of highways, escaping from its traffic din, at the same time harnessing its night for the mesmerising scene of moving lights to be admired from above. Architecture becomes a satirical backdrop for a social commentary.',

      'Urban matchmaking markets and the cultural moniker of “leftover women” reveal a peculiar marriage pressure faced by young women in China today, which is rooted in both political causes and Chinese cultural backgrounds.',
      'Addressing a women’s lack of autonomy towards love and critiquing the utilitarian attitude towards marriage, the project explores the role of architecture in creating settings for genuine and intimate encounters in the city of Beijing. Sited at major subway stations in Beijing, the project examines the overlooked events and encounters of the commute and re-imagines daily transit routines into opportunities for romantic encounters. Recognizing Beijing’s current ground environment designed for traffic and efficiency, I envision a new typology of a garden in the air above existing subway stations. Inspired by tactics of garden design in traditional Chinese literati gardens, the project aims to create moments of intimacy, connection and romance within an undesirable urban context.',

      'This project explores urban planning and design from an ecological perspective, integrating wildlife protection into the human living environment. Based on an extensive analysis of common wildlife in Singapore, their habitats and interactions with humans, the master plan for Tengah is overlaid with and adjusted by a computationally generated masterplan for potential animal flows and sightings. The result is a green and blue corridor running through housing estates linking existing water-based natural areas on either end. The estates are purposefully designed to support a smooth transition between urban and nature providing both animals and humans their safe areas while inviting for sightings and gentle interactions.',
    abstract: [
      'The thesis aims to explore an innovative urban design principle, which calls both the wildlife protection and better human living environment.  In Singapore, as a result of limited land space, it is inevitable to live together with urban wildlife. As the urban development increasing, it is necessary to find a new design proposal for proper human-animal relationship regarding the growing interaction. Meanwhile, a harmonious city with wildlife has become a unique identity of Singapore. Both biologically and culturally, the wildlife design proposal is strongly wanted. ',
      'To achieve it, animal shall be considered as the same citizen as people. The thesis attempt to treat all biological life in city as a target object interpreted by data and computer. The whole process is to build an ecological urban design of all scale with both theoretical and quantitative analysis.',

      'This thesis addresses a timely and important issue on aging in Singapore.

Her research and thesis iterations were rigorous. The sensitive and careful insertion of a\nflexible, technology-enabled modular system (activity cores) and retrofit of selected residential\nblocks for new living arrangements such as co-housing and assisted living are highly commendable.\n\nThe thesis is a demonstration of a solution that can be applied to other mature housing estates in\nSingapore.',

It takes a community-based approach to active and fulfilling 100-year lives through two moves: insertions made of a flexible, technology-enabled modular system (activity cores) and retrofitting selected residential blocks to support new living arrangements. These come together to create “ageless community hubs”, where residents of all ages support each other in pursuing purposeful activities and meaningful relationships.',

      'Highly insightful and innovative, RJ’s thesis not only provides the profession with a useful tool to explore, analyse and negotiate the complexity of practice with respect to stakeholders’ different interests, but also challenges the status quo of architects and architecture. More importantly, in the context of architecture thesis, this unconventional approach calls for a very needed reflection on the essence of thesis, especially on what kind of values that a thesis can potentially bring about to the profession and in which ways.

      'In the minefield of stakeholder tensions that stands between the practitioner and successful design outcomes, lies seen and unseen mines. Those we can see, we need to focus on defusing it. Left undefused, gaps in design outcomes will occur. Those we cannot see, we need to uncover them before it becomes too late to defuse.In response, this thesis proposes the Clumsy Architecture Initiative – a stakeholder tension  minesweeper – into the practitioners’ arsenal. The Minesweeper consist firstly a mine-defusing shared manual in the form of a knowledge repository that practitioners may find potential solutions',
      'to defuse these multitude of tension mines. And secondly a mine-detection toolkit to aid practitioners to uncover tension mines that we do not see. ',
      'Trial courses developed and delivered to groups of students demonstrated the efficacy of the mine-detector toolkit. They were able to grasp the toolkit quickly, uncover stakeholder tension mines effectively, and in response intuitively made tangible improvements to their design schemes. Practitioners introduced to the Clumsy Architecture Minesweeper express support for its practical application towards addressing a salient real-world problem, and the potential of its contribution to the profession. This thesis serves as a foundation for the Clumsy Architecture Minesweeper to be developed further and proliferated into local education and professional development.',
